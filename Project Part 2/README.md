Note that I am taking in input via command line arguments currently, for the sake of automating verification. You can always uncomment the first line in function main() to change that. You can run verify.sh to test the code on random strings of length up to 250 (each iteration takes 37 seconds on average, so be prepared to sit for 2 hrs to verify that the code runs correctly on 250 random strings.)
